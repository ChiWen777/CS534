1. after source the server python3.5 env, we need to install pandas lib
   pip install pandas
   pip install --upgrade pandas
2. for running part1 program
   python3.5 IA1.py
     in this program file includes two function:
     --grad_descent(normalized_train_data, y_train_data, learning)
     this function generates the weight matix
     --predict_test_y()
     this function to predict the test y value by using the weight we found
3. for running part2 program
   python3.5 IA1-part2.py
4. for running part3 program
   python3.5 IA1-part3.py
